SQL Training Pre-preparation assignment

Step 1: Install PostgreSQL
- Download and install the latest version of PostgreSQL. you can find the installa<on files for 
their specific opera<ng system on the official PostgreSQL website 
(hBps://www.postgresql.org/download/).

Step 2: Install DBeaver
- Please install DBeaver, which is a popular and free mul<-database tool that provides a GUI 
for working with databases. you can download it from the DBeaver website 
(hBps://dbeaver.io/download/).

Step 3: Sample Database
- The Northwind database is used for training purposes in our training. You can download a 
copy of the Northwind database for PostgreSQL from this GitHub repository: 
hBps://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql

Step 4: Restoring the Sample Database
- Restore the sample database into your PostgreSQL installa<on using the `pg_restore` or 
`psql` command-line tools. Please download necessary file or dump file from the 
downloaded Northwind database repository.
Here's an example of how to restore a PostgreSQL database from a dump file using the 
`pg_restore` command:
pg_restore -U username -d database_name path/to/dumpfile.sql
Replace `username` with the PostgreSQL username, `database_name` with the desired 
database name, and `path/to/dumpfile.sql` with the path to the dump file.

Step 5: Verify Database ConnecDon in DBeaver
- Create a new database connec<on in DBeaver to connect to restored PostgreSQL database. 
provide the connec<on details such as the host, port, database name, username, and 
password
